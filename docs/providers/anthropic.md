# Anthropic
## Configuration

```php
'anthropic' => [
    'api_key' => env('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY', ''),
    'version' => env('ANTHROPIC_API_VERSION', '2023-06-01'),
]
```

## Considerations
### Message Order

- Message order matters. Anthropic is strict about the message order being:

1. `UserMessage`
2. `AssistantMessage`
3. `UserMessage`

### Structured Output

While Anthropic models don't have native JSON mode or structured output like some providers, Prism implements a robust workaround for structured output:

- We automatically append instructions to your prompt that guide the model to output valid JSON matching your schema
- If the response isn't valid JSON, Prism will raise a PrismException

## Limitations
### Messages

Most providers' API include system messages in the messages array with a "system" role. Anthropic does not support the system role, and instead has a "system" property, separate from messages.

Therefore, for Anthropic we:
* Filter all `SystemMessage`s out, omitting them from messages.
* Always submit the prompt defined with `->withSystemPrompt()` at the top of the system prompts array.
* Move all `SystemMessage`s to the system prompts array in the order they were declared.

### Images

Does not support `Image::fromURL`
