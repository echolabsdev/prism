# Roadmap

Prism is constantly evolving to meet the needs of developers working with Large Language Models. Here's a glimpse into our development plans, categorized into short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals.

## Short-Term Goals

Our immediate focus is on refining existing functionalities and adding crucial features:

1. **`text` Refinements**: Enhancing the core text generation capabilities to provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

2. **Error Handling Refinements**: Improving the robustness of the package by implementing more comprehensive error handling mechanisms.

3. **Tool Use Refinements**: Optimizing the way Prism integrates and utilizes external tools, making it easier for developers to extend the AI's capabilities.

4. **`text` Image Support**: Adding the ability to generate and process images alongside text, expanding Prism's multimodal capabilities.

## Mid-Term Goals

Looking ahead, we plan to introduce new functionalities that will significantly enhance Prism's versatility:

1. **`object` Functionality**: Implementing structured data generation, allowing for more precise and type-safe outputs in complex scenarios.

2. **`textStream` Functionality**: Enabling streaming of generated text, which will be particularly useful for real-time applications and improved user experiences.

3. **`embeddings` Functionality**: Introducing support for text embeddings, opening up possibilities for semantic search, text classification, and other advanced NLP tasks.

## Long-Term Goals

Our vision for Prism's future includes advanced features that will cement its position as a comprehensive AI integration solution:

1. **Middleware Functionality**: Developing a middleware system to allow for more flexible request/response manipulation and easier integration with existing Laravel applications.

2. **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Implementing support for OpenTelemetry to provide better observability and performance monitoring capabilities.

3. **First-Party Tools Repository**: Creating a collection of ready-to-use, drop-in tools that extend Prism's capabilities. This will include:
   - SerperAPI search tool for web search integration
   - Database query/exploration tool for AI-assisted database interactions
   - Additional tools to be determined based on community needs and emerging use cases

This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and emerging trends in the AI landscape. We're committed to making Prism the go-to solution for Laravel developers working with Large Language Models.
