Whether they should wear a coat (which relates to weather conditions)\n\nFor the first question, I need to search for the Tigers game schedule for today. For the second question, I need to check the weather in the relevant location.\n\nHowever, I'm missing some information:\n- The user hasn't specified which Tigers team they're referring to (though Detroit Tigers is most likely)\n- The user hasn't specified their location, which I need for the weather check\n\nI'll need to search for the Tigers game information first, and then check the weather in the appropriate location (likely Detroit if it's a home game).",
