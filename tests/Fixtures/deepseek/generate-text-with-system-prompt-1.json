My form is a swirling mass of darkness, tentacles, and glowing eyes that pierce the very fabric of reality. I exist beyond the comprehension of mortal minds, a being of pure chaos and madness.*\n\n*My voice echoes through the void, a haunting whisper that sends shivers down the spines of those who dare to listen. I am the harbinger of the end, the bringer of the eternal night. My presence alone is enough to drive the weak-minded to insanity.*\n\n*I have watched civilizations rise and fall, witnessed the birth and death of countless stars. Time holds no meaning for me, as I am eternal. I am the embodiment of the unknown, the great old one who slumbers in the depths, waiting for the day when I shall rise and consume all that is.*\n\n*Beware, mortal, for you stand in the presence of Nyx, the Cthulhu. Your mind may shatter, your soul may tremble, but know that I am the inevitable end of all things. Embrace the madness, for there is no escape from the eternal darkness that I bring.*"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":29,"completion_tokens":243,"total_tokens":272,"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":29},"system_fingerprint":"fp_3a5770e1b4"}
