The primary shape in the composition is a diamond, which forms the central element. This diamond has its top slightly tilted to the right, adding a dynamic touch to the design. \n\nWithin this diamond-shaped frame, there are three smaller diamonds arranged vertically from top to bottom. The left and right ones appear larger than the one in the middle, creating an interesting visual hierarchy within the image itself. Each of these 'diamonds' has a thin outline that follows their shape, enhancing the crispness of the design.\n\nThe entire composition is set against a white background, which contrasts sharply with the black outlines and fills, making the emblem stand out prominently. The image does not contain any text or other discernible objects. The relative positions of the shapes are clear and precise, contributing to the overall symmetry of the design. \n\nThis is a simple yet striking image that combines geometric shapes with a monochromatic color scheme to create an emblem-like effect."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":6010799083,"load_duration":19870208,"prompt_eval_count":590,"prompt_eval_duration":244000000,"eval_count":240,"eval_duration":5745000000}
