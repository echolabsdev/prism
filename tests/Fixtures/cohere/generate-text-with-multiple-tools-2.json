        "text": "The Detroit Tigers are playing the Minnesota Twins today at 1:10 pm. Whether you need a coat depends on the temperature and your sensitivity to cold. The current temperature in Detroit is 57°F and mostly cloudy. Forecasts suggest it will feel like 57°F throughout the game with 79% humidity and a 14% chance of precipitation. If you're sitting in the sun, the game might be comfortable in a long-sleeved shirt, but you might want to bring a coat if you're planning to be in the shade or the evening cools down. Better safe than cold!"
